# Commits and Improvements
This is my first official webpage as well as my first repository here on github. If you have an issue with the code I wrote feel free
to make your own changes. I know a lot of improvments can be made when it comes to the javascript code but also the css styling or the design
of the page, but I am very new to web dev and have only been coding for 2 weeks. Thanks.




# DISCLAIMER
This webpage project is not to be taken fully seriously as you may have personal needs for different doses of daily protein. Consultate with a medical professional before using. (I know disclaimers are boring)
